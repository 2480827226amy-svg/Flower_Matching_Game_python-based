# Flower Swap Elimination Game

## Overview
This project is a click-based tile swapping and elimination game built in Python. 
Players swap flowers to form matches of three same color, which are then automatically eliminated.

## Game Mechanics
- Click-to-select flower
- flower color validation by flowerpot
- Steps tracking

## List of files:
1. opening.py: the opening page including a start buttom to start the entire game.
2. main.py: where we run the game
3. levels.py: the level page with 3 levels for users to choose from
4. level1.py: the first level of game and the game logic
5. level2.py: the second level of game and the game logic
6. level3.py: he third level of game and the game logic

## Algorithm Design

### 1. Entering and levels page
Entering the game, the level page launch into different files of different game designs.  

### 2. Board Representation
The flowerpots are recorded with dictionary, with color as value and position as key. 

### 3. Swap Validation
Records users' steps: if within steps limitation, then allows swap

### 3. Match Detection
The algorithm determines if the flowers in each flowerpot are of same color. 
Prints "win" if all flowers within each flowerpot are of the same color. 

## How to Run
python main.py

## Future Improvements
- Add animation
- Add combo scoring
- Refactor detection into optimized pattern scanning
